                    Every corner, every city has a beautiful story that is waiting to be told. Moreover, Greece has always been famous for 
                    its good prices compared to other famous parts of Europe. While it is true that there are a lot of fancy and expensive 
                    establishments in Greece, it is actually possible to explore this diverse country on a budget. Traditional tavernas and
                    kafeneia are quite cheap and beaches are free for all to enjoy.</p>

                    There is a reason why Greece shines when it comes to the tourism industry, why it attracts so many
                    visitors every year and why so many people fall in love with it. In fact, there are a lot of reasons for this!
                    Greece is blessed with some of the most beautiful beaches and islands in the world, and tourism has always
                    been a key element of their economy, so over the years they have perfected the services they offer to
                    tourists coming to their country. In other words, the Greek are aware of their appeal to people all over 
                    the world looking for a relaxing seaside vacation, and they know very well how to take advantage of this and
                    please their visitors so as to create an ideal holiday experience for them.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Without a doubt, the natural wonders of Greece will leave you stunned. Its pristine islands and shorelines are incredible and the 
                    perfect choice for a relaxing holiday by the beach, but Greece also offers so much more than that, which
                    many people tend to forget. Greece is an extremely diverse country in terms of landscapes, architecture and culture and even though
                    they are often overshadowed by crystal blue waters and sandy beaches many beautiful places can be found on the mainland as well,
                    some prime examples being the cliffs of Meteora, or the city of Thessaloniki. Greece can also cater to any history enjoyer,
                    because of its rich and eventful past and mythology that will leave anyone mesmerized. Take the time to visit the Acropolis,
                    open-air museum of Dolos, Parthenon, Temple of Olympian - Zeus to name a few.
                    All of these structures are still well maintained and provide a beautiful glimpse of Greece's wonderful glorious past.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One thing that's sure about your holiday to Greece is that it will allow you to get lost in their culture.
                    The Greek experience showcases traditional food, music, dances and much more so be sure to give them all a chance, because
                    they are some of the most valuable treasures Greece has to offer.

                <p>Parga is hands down the most popular holiday destination in Epirus, located on the north-western side of Greece. The seafront landscape combined with the colorful architecture
                   of the town will remind you of the Greek islands. The town's Venetian castle will be among the first things to catch your eye! 
                   In addition to the breathtaking sea views, lush green nature and amazing sights, you will discover beaches with an exotic atmosphere.
                   Parga boasts a unique natural setting and what's fascinating about it is that although it is a mainland town, its scenery reminds of an island! That's why it is a popular destination for summer holidays.</p>

                        The picturesque town of Parga and the surrounding areas will make you fall in love with Greece and want to return as soon as possible.
                        Built amphitheatrically on the slopes of a mountain, and at the same time one step away from the seashore, it is an idyllic resort that uniquely combines the beautiful mountain side with the sea.
                        It has many elegant two-story mansions with colorful walls, traditional tavernas and bars, beautiful churches, monuments and shops.
                        What's more, right in front of Parga, there are tiny exotic islets, which you can visit by boat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The main attraction in Parga is, hands down, the Venetian castle, which towers over the town. Built in 1792 by the Venetians, the Castle of Parga, as it is also called, was strategically constructed
                        for defensive purposes. Around the castle, there are 8 towers that boost the castle's defense, while lower on the hill, there are traditional houses sitting around the Venetian castle.
                        Visiting the castle is like entering another era! Supplies galleries, bastions, arched alleys, hidden passages, warehouses, forts… It's not a stretch of imagination to picture the glorious battles that once took place here!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But of course, Parga's beaches won't leave you disappointed either! They are one of the main reasons Parga is famous and some of the most
                        exotic and wild beaches out there in Greece. Places like these, that still seem largely untouched by human activity, are becoming more and 
                        more rare and many people love to find somewhere that they can call their own, where to enjoy nature in its most unaltered form. Apart from many secluded beaches
                        that wait to be discovered, you can check out some of the more popular beaches, like Valtos, Kryoneri, Lichnos and Sarakiniko. You'll find some of the most beautiful
                        places in Parga's coves with fine white sand and mesmerizing turquoise, crystal clear, waters. Take a look over the <a href="./gallery.html#beaches">gallery</a> and <a href="./what-to-do.html">here</a>
                        to familiarise yourself with the beaches around Parga.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another great selling point of Parga is its proximity to the Ionian islands (Corfu, Zakynthos, Kefalonia and Paxi) or to Sivota, an
                        enchanting traditional settlement located on the south part of Thesprotia district. You can enhance your vacation even more by taking the opportunity
                        to become familiar with the surroundings of Parga.

                <div id="extra3">
                    <p>The Kanaria Festival is celebrated in Parga every summer, on August 14th. Residents of the town itself, locals from the surrounding areas 
                        and visitors participate in this celebration. It aims to commemorate the return of the old residents from Corfu to Parga. 
                        In 1817, the residents of Parga migrated to the nearby island of Corfu in order to save themselves from the Turks, to whom their town had been sold. 
                        However, when the Greek War of Independence ended, in the 1830s, the Pargiotes came back to their birth land.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although Parga was finally deliberated from the Turkish occupation almost a century later, in 1912, the residents still celebrate the return of their forefathers from Corfu as an important event. 
                        Varkarola festivity also forms part of the Kanaria festival: two series of boats, decorated in the Venetian way, start from the castle area and crossing the bay, wharf in the harbor of Parga, while fireworks explode and people are singing and dancing.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Source of text content about Kanaria festival: https://www.greeka.com/epirus/parga/festivals/kanaria-festival/ -->

                    <p>Regarding the taste of Parga, you can eat the Greek way at one of the many charming restaurants in town. If you're looking for something more traditional,
                        you must try one of the restaurants and tavernas which serve classic Greek dishes and staples of the Greek cuisine, like taramasalata, tzatziki,
                        moussaka, feta cheese, baklava and of course, a lot of fresh fish and seafood! You can dance to the tunes of traditional Greek music at one of the local tavernas and if that's not for you,
                        try one of the clubs. In any case, there's something for everyone to explore in Parga!

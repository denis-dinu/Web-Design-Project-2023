                <p>
                    Once you get to Parga, finding things to do and enjoy is very easy, but how do you actually get there? Unfortunately, this might be
                    the hardest thing to plan about your trip, as Parga doesn't currently have an airport, but don't let this discourage you, as there are
                    many ways to get to Parga from other places in Greece. There are two airports nearby, Ioannina National Airport (103 km away) and Aktion National Airport in Preveza (65 km away),
                    another bigger airport in Corfu that can help you get there, as well as buses, ferries and car rental services that can link Athens to Parga.

                <button id="show">Show routes</button>

                <div id="extra">
                    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> Route 1 - Ioannina National Airport</h3>
                    <p>The airport of Ioannina receives daily flights from Athens, but no international flights. From there, only a 2 hours drive separates you from Parga. There are taxis which can take you
                        straight from the airport to your hotel in Parga (you can also book one in advance at 0030 26840 32855 or 0030 694 8738 847), but a cheaper way would probably be taking a bus.
                    </p>

                    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> Route 2 - Aktion National Airport in Preveza</h3>
                    <p>The airport of Aktion-Preveza operates only in summer, during months of peak demand and receives charter flights from abroad, but no flights from other
                        parts of Greece. It is the closest to Parga, at only one hour of driving away. Again, taxis are available but you can also book a transfer from Preveza to
                        Parga <a href="https://transfers.greeka.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> Route 3 - A nearby international airport like Ioannis Kapodistrias Airport in Corfu</h3>
                    <p>Corfu is an island in the Ionian sea which has an airport that conveniently receives both domestic flights from Athens or Thessaloniki and charter flights from
                        many parts of Europe. After getting to Corfu, you'll want to take a ferry to Igoumenitsa and then a bus to Parga.
                    </p>

                    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-car"></i> / <i class="fa-solid fa-bus"></i> Route 4 - Car/bus from Athens airport</h3>
                    <p>Being the capital of Greece, the airport in Athens regularly receives flights from all over the world. The challenging part is getting from Athens to Parga.
                        Renting a car would be recommended here, as it would allow for the greatest flexibility and comfort for your journey, and you'll also be able to check out some 
                        great places near Parga easily later on during your vacation. Here's how to get from Athens to Parga by car: 
                        <!-- The following text content is taken from: https://www.greeka.com/epirus/parga/travel/ -->
                        drive through the National Greek Road Athens - Corinth and after the Corinth Canal you have to follow the route to Patra. 
                        Afterwards, you need to drive through the National Greek Roads Olimpia and Ionia. In other words, after Patra you will pass by Mesolongi, Amfilochia and Arta among other places. 
                        The distance between Athens and Parga is about 433 km. Alternatively, you can take the bus to Preveza-Parga which departs from Kifissos Bus Station in Athens and the trip is about 10 hours.
                    </p>

                    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-ferry"></i> Route 5 - Bring your own car by ferry!</h3>
                    <!-- The following text content is taken from: https://www.greeka.com/greece-travel/ -->
                    <p>Ferry companies are operating between Italy and Greece all year round. Particularly there are ferries from Trieste, Venice, Ancona, Bari and Brindisi in Italy to Patra, Igoumenitsa, Corfu and Kefalonia in Greece, 
                        facilitating European visitors who want to come with their car.
